### FUNDING SOURCES###

Sometimes I have funding for students and postdocs, sometimes I don't. In either case, it is very useful for you to apply for your own funding. Getting a good grant or fellowship looks very good on your CV. It also gives you more flexibility and security. 
Below is a list of external funding sources for students and postdocs. Entries are listed in no particular order. This list is by no means complete, if you know of any good sources I omitted, or if you find outdated information, please let me know.
