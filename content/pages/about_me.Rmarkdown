### Dr. Handel's short academic biography ### 

##### __1/2009 - PRESENT__ ##### 
I am currently an Associate Professor in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/epibio/),
[College of Public Health](http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/), at the [University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu/). 
I also have adjunct appointments in UGA's [Department of Infectious Diseases in the College of Veterinary Medicine](http://www.vet.uga.edu/id/people)
and in the [Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health](http://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/# AHANDEL) 
at Emory University. I am a Member of UGA's [Institute of Bioinformatics](http://iob.uga.edu/faculty/) and 
[Faculty of Infectious Diseases](https://fid.ovpr.uga.edu/umdf/?c=directory).

##### __8/2004 - 12/2008__ #####
I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Biology](http://www.emory.edu/BIOLOGY/) 
at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/) in the group of [Rustom Antia](http://www.biology.emory.edu/Antia/). 
During my Postdoc, I used the mathematical and computational approaches that I learned during my Ph.D. to 
study the dynamics of pathogens, both on the within-host level during individual infections and the between-host, 
population level.

##### __8/1999 - 7/2004__ #####
I obtained a Ph.D. in physics from the [Center for Nonlinear Science](http://cns.physics.gatech.edu/) and 
[School of Physics](http://www.physics.gatech.edu/), [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu/). 
I worked with [Roman Grigoriev](http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~roman/) on the topic of localized control of spatially 
extended, nonlinear dynamical systems. My research combined elements from [fluid mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics), 
[applied mathematics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_mathematics), [dynamical systems theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) 
and [control theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory). If you want to learn more, you can read the introduction of 
[my thesis](http://handelgroup.uga.edu/publications/handel04thesis.pdf), which should be understandable to non-experts.

8/1996 - 7/1999
I received my B.S. (or what could be considered the German equivalent) from the [Department of Physics](http://www.physik.uni-stuttgart.de/index.en.html), 
[University of Stuttgart](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) in Germany. My focus areas were 
[nonlinear dynamics/chaos theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dynamics) and 
[scientific computation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_computation).

#### Additional Information about me ####

My current [Erdős number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is (as far as I'm aware) __4__. 
(Paul Erdős -> Ernst Gabor Straus -> Raymond M. Redheffer -> Sergei S. Pilyugin -> Andreas Handel).
