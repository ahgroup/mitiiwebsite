Welcome to the MITII Research Center website!

We are a research center funded by the NIH Modeling Immunity for Biodefense program.  We are primarily focused on how pre-existing immunity affects immune responses to influenza, the infection chosen due to its relevance to human health and tractability.

More information about our research projects and can be found in the current project descriptions and publications from completed projects. We have also developed software as part of this center, which can be found in the resources section.
