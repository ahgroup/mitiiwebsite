We are interested in the dynamics of influenza, both on the within-host level and the between-host level. On the within-host level, we try to gain a better and more quantitative understanding as to what drives the infection dynamics and leads to virus clearance. On the between-host levels, we study the spread and potential control of the virus. Current specific projects we work on are:

* Persistence of avian influenza in the environment
* Adaptive immune responses to influenza
* Dose-dependent influenza infection outcomes
