We are developing R packages to help with immunological modeling. The first package provides immunologists and other bench scientists a user-friendly introduction to dynamical modeling of within-host infection, without the need to write computer code.

The second package allows users to build and analyze compartmental, dynamical, mechanistic models (implemented as differential equations, discrete-time or stochastic), without the need to write computer code.
